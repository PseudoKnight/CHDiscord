# CHDiscord

This is CommandHelper extension that uses the JDA library to talk to your Discord server.

You'll need to have created a Discord application [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). Then add a Bot to it. Grab the "TOKEN" for the Bot that you'll use to connect this extension to Discord. Finally, you'll need your server id, which you can get by right-clicking your server name and clicking "Copy ID". 

You have to run discord_connect() before you can use the other functionality of this extension, otherwise a NotFoundException will be thrown.

## Functions

### discord_connect(token, server_id, [callback] | profile, [callback])
Connects to Discord server via token and server id.
The optional callback closure will be executed when a connection is made.
The profile may be a string, which should refer to a profile defined in profiles.xml,
with the keys token and serverId, or an array, with the same keys.

The profile should be defined such as

    <profile id="discordCredentials">
        <type>discord</type>
        <token>abcdefg</token>
        <serverId>12345</serverId>
    </profile>

### discord_disconnect()

### discord_delete_message(channel, id)

### discord_private_message(user, string)
Sends a private message to the specified Discord server member.
